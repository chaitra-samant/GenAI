Dear Tom,
I am writing to inform you that, unfortunately, I will be unable to attend the meeting that was scheduled for 10am today.
I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding in this matter.
However, I would like to propose an alternative. I am available to meet at 12:00pm at the conference room.
Please let me know if this time works for you.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best regards,
[Your Name]
